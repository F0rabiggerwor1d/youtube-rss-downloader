# youtube-rss-downloader<br />
a script to ping a databse of youtube rss feeds and download the latest video if it has not already been downloaded <br />

Automaticly download videos from channels as soon as they come out with this handy windows service built in node (linux support coming all you data hoarders)<br />
This proejct is still in development (stuff may be broke)<br />

How to get started:<br />
1.first download the repository<br />
2.unzip the repository and put it somewhere you can easily access<br />
2.install nodejs (the recommended version) from here<br />
3.go into the repository folder and double click the insatll.bat file, this will install all the needed modules for you and setup the database<br />
6.whenever you want to add channels to the databse open addCreators.bat<br />
7.to test the script in a deveoloemnt enviroment open dev.bat<br />
8.ready to commit then put a ring on it (i mean open service.bat)<br />
9.this breaks google TOS so dont hunt me down please if smth happens <br />
10. if you want this taken down google hmu (plz no dmca)<br />

Caviats:<br />
.the script suffers from dumb logic and other stuff<br />
